    <h2>Most Popular cars in Nigeria</h2>
    <p>Moving on a major road in Nigeria, it is a difficult fact to miss; that there are particular brands of cars seen than others.</p> 
    <p>One would argue that the reason is because some are more expensive than others and many citizens are within a financial strength, but I beg to differ. <br> The major sentiments for me for most vehicle owners are as follows;</p>
    <ul><li>Fuel Economy.</li>
        <li>Affordability and Availability of Vehicle parts.</li>
        <li>Ease of Maintenance, and possibly the most important,</li>
        <li>Total financial strenght of the user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because if you would agree with me, <em>there is a car for everyone</em> <strong>OR maybe not.</strong>
