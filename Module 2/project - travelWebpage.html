<h1> Famous Kenyan Tourist locations </h1> 
<p> Kenya – the name is almost synonymous with the word "safari." Few other places on the planet conjure such a spirit of adventure and romance. The diversity of things to do in Kenya dazzles all who visit, and viewing the country's abundant wildlife tops the list.

		<h2> Lists of top-rated locations in Kenya </h2>

				<li class="item">AMBOSELI NATIONAL PARK</li>

				<p>Beyond the world-famous safari parks lies a trove of coastal treasures. You can snorkel and dive fish-rich coral reefs, relax on pearly beaches, experience the melting pot of cultures and cuisines in Mombasa and Malindi, and explore tropical islands steeped in Swahili history.
				Topographically, Kenya is stunning. Surrounded by calderas and mountain ranges, the Great Rift Valley divides the country. To the east of this sweeping valley, you can climb the snow-cloaked equatorial peaks of Mount Kenya and fish for trout in crystal-clear streams. Hell's Gate National Park harbors obsidian caves and hisses with natural geysers and hot springs.</p>

			<li class="item">MAASAI MARA NATIONAL RESERVE </li>
			<img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/KEN/kenya-Maasai-mara.jpg" width="50%" alt="Maasai Mara National Reserve">
			<p>Maasai Mara National Reserve (also "Masai Mara") is one of Africa's most magnificent game reserves. Bordering Tanzania, the Mara is the northern extension of the Serengeti and forms a wildlife corridor between the two countries.
			It's named after the statuesque, red-cloaked Maasai people who live in the park and graze their animals here, as they have done for centuries. In their language, Mara means "mottled," perhaps a reference to the play of light and shadow from the acacia trees and cloud-studded skies on the vast grasslands.
			The park is famous for the Great Migration, when thousands of wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle travel to and from the Serengeti, from July through October.
			In the Mara River, throngs of hippos and crocodiles lurk. The park is also known for providing excellent predator sightings, thanks to its relatively large populations of lion, cheetah, and leopard – especially in the dry months from December through February.
			Thanks to the park's altitude, the weather here is mild and gentle year-round.</p>
